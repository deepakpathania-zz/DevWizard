					We were the overall first prize winner at Magic Bricks' Build-a-thon, 2016. We created a chat bot that re invents home search. It basically allows multiple users to decide and filter house lstings simultaneously. Each message that is directed at the bot is considered as a filter to narrow done home options which were fetched using the in-house Magic bricks' API. Multiple users can then chat as they normally would and filter the options based on the messages they send, for eg. it should be near a metro station., and it would filter down all the options that satisfy this query. The bot can be easily added to ay group and then each group member can give commands to the bot.</h3>

					We built a travel chat bot named Trippy. It helps users find the ideal destination based on the available time and 
					their mood by chatting with it and filtering responses through chat messages.
					The user can also click any picture and send it to the bot from which text
					is extracted and then translated to the desired language so that they never
					get lost. Plus nobody wants to watch those long travel guides, right ? 
					We allow users to upload videos and we then convert the speech into text, 
					feed that text to our summarizer and give them a short summary of the entire 
					video along with sentiment analysis of the summary. The user can also tweet about their experiences directly from the bot.</h3>

					We were awarded for the best usage of HPE Haven OnDemand API at Hack InOut where we used the sentiment analysis, speech recognition, OCR and entity extraction API provided by HPE's Haven OnDemand platform to build a lot of cool stuff like an image translator, a video sumaarizer and a video rating system built into a chat bot. We were awarded with a GoPro camera each for this and made the entire project open source. Feel free to play around with it, tweak it and build something more awesome with it. </h3>

					We built a product named Sudo which allows users to search for things in videos just like you would search
					for stuff in text files and highlight the appearances of the searched 
					keyword in video's timeline and allows you to skip directly to that part. 
					It also allows you to summarize long texts according to your reading
					habits and the available time you have. We also built a cross platform chat 
					system along with video calling to support the overall functionality with 
					a feature to broadcast your mobile screen to larger devices through
					socket connections.</h3>

					We built Legitimize ,which is a free web builder and entrepreneur partner finding platform for women entrepreneurs. Since it can be really challenging for small scale women entrepreneurs to hire dev guys, we developed a web builder system that lets them make their own websites with no prior tech knowledge required, by drag and drop functionality. Not just that, we have a dedicated peer to peer chat and video call system, available for women to find like minded women in their space so that they can collaborate, develop and grow together.
